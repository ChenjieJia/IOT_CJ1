###  **Tenth week**   
  [2020-10-30]  
  Lab 7: Cloud Platforms: ThingSpeak, Google Sheets.  
###  **Ninth week**    
  [2020-10-27]  
  Lab 6: Alternative Devices, Particle Cloud, Node.js.  
  [2020-10-26]  
  Try to build a UI to check the room temperature and humidity.  
  [2020-10-25]  
  The real-time temperature and humidity data collected by DHT11 is sent by Raspberry Pi to Aliyun platform successfully, and is set to be updated every 5 seconds.  
  [2020-10-23]  
  Equipped with a 38KHZ universal infrared receiver and transmitter module.  
###  **Eighth week**    
  [2020-10-21]  
  Make the RaspberryPi connect to the Aliyun and show the video online.  
###  **Seventh week**    
  [2020-10-18]   
  Lab 5: Crossbar.io, Eclipse Mosquitto and Eclipse Paho.  
  [2020-10-17]   
  The RaspberryPi successfully connected to the camera and realized video and photo functions, next step: try to connect to the Aliyun to show the video.  
  [2020-10-15]  
  Use Winscp to make the Windows and Linux transfer files freely.    
  Use Synergy to make my desktop and RaspberryPi share the same mouse and keyboard , also the set RaspberryPi to start Synergy automatically when power-on.  
  [2020-10-14]   
  Purchase MB-102 bread boards and various dupont lines and corresponding power modules.  
  New Development Steps:
    1. Install LIRC (LINUX infrared remote control) for Raspberry Pi.    
    2. Register Aliyun account and open the Aliyun Internet of Things platform.  
      a. Raspberry PI as device accessed: Device platform: Linux; Device connection protocol: MQTT; Device development kit: Node.js.    
      b. Download python3 and SDK for RaspberryPi.    
      c. Use the python example scripts which is offered by Aliyun website, modify Aliyun platform's ProductKey/DeviceSecret/DeviceName, run the program, successfully connect the Aliyun.    
    3. Connecting the same mouse system back and forth between the RaspberryPi and my laptop was a hassle, so I chose to try sharing the keyboard mouse between computers. Synergy maybe a good way to help to share the keyboard mouse and the clipboard.    
###  **Sixth week**  
  [2020-10-07]
  Lab 4: Django and Django REST, Flask, LAMP.   
###  **Fifth week**  
  [2020-10-02]  
  Lab 3: Python, Remote GPIO, PyPy, Doeygen.  
  [2020-10-01]  
  The creation of mind maps.  
  The functions and tasks of each module are specified.   
  The ultimate target of the project is to use the Siri assistant of IOS to remotely control the air conditioner.    
###  **Fourth week**
  [2020-09-26]  
  Lab 2: General-purpose input/ouput(GPIO) and serial communication, Serial peripheral interface(SPI), Breadboard, Light-emitting diode(LED), Inter-integrated circuit(I2C), 1-Wire, USB Webcam.  
  [2020-09-24]  
  Install the raspberry PI system, purchase the corresponding temperature sensor, humidity sensor, infrared receiving and sending equipment, familiar with their control situation.   
###  **Third week**   
  [2020-09-18]  
  Lab 1: NOOBS and Wi-Fi, Configuration, Startup Mailer, SSH and VNC, VNC Connect.  
  [2020-09-17]  
  Using RaspBerryPi as a controller for air conditioning which can be operated remotely through Internet. Besides, it can collect the actual indoor temperature and humidity, and adjust.  
  Different strategies to control the temperature, humidity and wind speed in different states, so as to achieve the best real-time control state.  
###  **Second week**  
  [2020-09-10]  
  Purchase the RaspberryPi 4B with a camera and a display screen.  
  Try to use the RaspberryPi and call the camera, since I used to be familiar with C++ and matlab in the past , maybe I still need some time to grasp the Python.
